Python code for paper published on http://ijcs.net/ijcs/index.php/ijcs/article/view/3862

This study analyzes trend dynamics of religious authority in discussions about Islam on Twitter between 2009 and 2019, using Katz centrality and Laplacian centrality. According to both methods, the findings indicate that dominance in religious conversations tends not to be held by religious authorities, with the average percentage of religious authority appearances only 14.24% in Katz centrality and 12.42% in Laplacian centrality.

Datasets were obtained from X/Twitter with islamic keywords such as "Quran", "Hadits", "Masjid", with range from 2009-2019, and in Bahasa Indonesia.
Due to privacy issues, datasets can't be published.
